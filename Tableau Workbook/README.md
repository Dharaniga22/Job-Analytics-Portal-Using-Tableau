#  Workbook Files

Due to file size constraints, the Tableau workbook has been compressed and split into **three parts** using WinRAR. You can download all parts and extract them using any archive manager that supports `.part` files (like WinRAR or 7-Zip).

# Uploaded Files

- `Job Analytics Portal.part1.rar`
- `Job Analytics Portal.part2.rar`
- `Job Analytics Portal.part3.rar`

> To open the full workbook:
1. Download **all three parts**.
2. Place them in the **same folder**.
3. Right-click `Job Analytics Portal.part1.rar` and choose **Extract Here** (your archive tool will automatically join the parts).

#  Dataset
The raw dataset used for analysis is available in the `Dataset` folder.
